Bug Found: weren't resetting modulation buffer before each raysPerPixel iteration
=============================================================
Found thanks to Morgan



2016-10-01:
=============================================================

![](2016-10-01_004_3-paths_r1198_g3d_r875__.jpg)

added code to reset modulation buffer,tried to move writeToImage inside the for
loop and nothing seems to change



2016-10-01: when we don't modify the modulation buffer at all
=============================================================

![](2016-10-01_003_3-paths_r1198_g3d_r875__.jpg)

5 rays vs 25 rays vs 50 rays, the noise gets slightly smaller



Also seem to have inconsistencies with which are bumping point for recursive rays but works better for what seems to be the wrong way
=============================================================

are bumping by (EPSILON * surfel->geometricNormal * (-sign(surfel->geometricNormal.dot(-directionIn))));

Seems like should be (EPSILON * surfel->geometricNormal * (-sign(surfel->geometricNormal.dot(directionIn))));


Can't figure out why our images get so dark
=============================================================



Turning up the rays doesnt change the fact that the faces not touched by direct light are always black, which indicates our direct rays arent working well
=============================================================

When you stop multiplying the modulation buffer by the 'weight' we have normal levels of light

Image  gets very dark when we increase number of rays per pixel
=============================================================

2016-09-30: Iteration Bug fixed
=============================================================

![](2016-09-30_003_3-paths_r1164_g3d_r875__.jpg)

we were using x*y + x instead of x*width + x for the i value that iterates
through our loop




Changed scatter function to not use Russian Roulette
=============================================================

Fixed CheckVisibility to correctly return when surfel is null
=============================================================




Put Image Writing before modulationBuffer Updating

What in the world happened
=============================================================

Shadow Ray isn;t intersecting anything, why???
==========================================

For some reason. our shadow rays (from the light to the surfel) aren't intersecting anything, which doesnt make any sense.
For now will just check for that happening, but am very confused as to why.
