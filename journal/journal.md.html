Hey So
=========================
We're sorry we took so long. We tried to abide by the time controls, and did stop at 8 jours after we saw your email, but then had to finish the report and tests.


2016-09-26: MVP report done
=============================================================
checkmark


2016-09-26: Images gathered
=============================================================
Since we couldn't use our own intersection methods, we used G3D::TriTreeBase::intersectRay. We are not claiming it as our work, but rather using it to demonstrate our other code.
We are building our custom scene, trying to keep it simple.


2016-09-26: Testing complete
=============================================================
All tests performed and graphs gathered. Producing 640x400 images now

2016-09-26: Testing 
=============================================================
Using a google sheet to perform our tests


2016-09-26: Splitting up tasks
=============================================================
Eli is handling this journal and report. Ryan is adding the last GUI elements and prepping for 
running tests. 


2016-09-25: Sphere intersection: the lost cause
=============================================================
We might revisit it briefly, but we have to throw in the towel. Intersection
is not within reach unless we're putting in more hours than Morgan would like. Giving in
isn't fun.

We're just going to clean up this journal, generate some graphs for the report using Morgan's 
intersection code, clean up the comments for whichever poor soul has to use this code in the future, 
and then give our final commit. 


2016-09-25: Visual Studio hates sphere intersection 
=============================================================
We have a sphere intersection method that we believe to be (mostly) correct, but Visual Studio is 
throwing a tantrum, saying that our custom sphere class (OurSphere) is actually a template? It's throwing
so many weird errors concerning that one line that make absolutely no sense. Nobody in the lab knows what's going 
on with the error messages.


2016-09-25: Back to intersection
=============================================================
We're having serious trouble. As recommended, we backtracked and are trying to get
sphere intersection working. We started with triangle because we had some form of the code for
it and thought we understood what was going on. It appears that wasn't the case.


2016-09-25: POLISH: Streaks eliminated
=============================================================

![THE STREAKS ARE GONE](2016-09-25_005_2-rays_r898_g3d_r848__THE_STREAKS_ARE_GONE.jpg)

Jamie helped us isolate the problem: we weren't bumping the indirect rays before tracing them.



2016-09-25: POLISH, revisited
=============================================================
Jamie messaged us about indirect rays, so we're taking a break with intersection and are now trying to make
our indirect rays streak-free. She wanted to compare 10 indirect rays with 20:

![10 indirect rays](2016-09-25_003_2-rays_r898_g3d_r848__.jpg)
![20 indirect rays](2016-09-25_004_2-rays_r898_g3d_r848__.jpg)

2016-09-25: MVP Intersection: work in progress
=============================================================

![Lower res](2016-09-25_002_2-rays_r888_g3d_r848__WHY.jpg)
Interestingly, when we lower the res, the left rectangle _kind of_ appears?
We don't know why this is. All focus is on this intersection, because MVP is within reach if we can get it.


2016-09-25: First stab at intersections
=============================================================

![](2016-09-25_001_2-rays_r888_g3d_r848__.jpg)

Somehow managed to ignore the boxes? We don't know why that is. At least it
compiles...



2016-09-24: Relapse (eminem style)
=============================================================
We've made some huge mistakes. Went way off the MVP rails trying to get our indirect light rendering working. 
We're having weird streaking issues that we can't figure out.
![This is way better than before though](2016-09-25_000_2-rays_r885_g3d_r848__This_is_way_better_than_before_though.jpg)


However, we did get basic multithreading.



2016-09-23: Huge time improvement
=============================================================
Moved TriTree and Light array construction to the highest level, as it will be the same 

2016-09-24: ...still present with indirect lights, though
=============================================================

![](2016-09-24_003_2-rays_r831_g3d_r848__.jpg)



2016-09-24: Shadow acne mostly solved
=============================================================

![](2016-09-24_002_2-rays_r831_g3d_r848__.jpg)

Note the distinct lack of an acne breakout



2016-09-24: Indirect lights kind of working
=============================================================

![](2016-09-24_001_2-rays_r831_g3d_r848__.jpg)

We are dividing the recursive call by the amount of recursive calls... No idea
if this is right.



2016-09-24: Overexposed
=============================================================

![](2016-09-24_000_2-rays_r818_g3d_r848__.jpg)



2016-09-23: Shading working kind of
=============================================================

![Shading using default intersection code. Not our own. Need to bump rays](2016-09-23_004_2-rays_r815_g3d_r848__Shading_using_default_intersection_code__Not_our_own__Need_to_bump_rays.jpg)

Ray bumping proving challenging. We can't debug Ray::minDistance() because it isn't showing up in the list of locals when we make a variable for it, even when we use it.

2016-09-23: WOW
=============================================================

![](2016-09-23_003_2-rays_r814_g3d_r848__.jpg)



2016-09-23: Basic shading is go!
=============================================================

![Basic shading implemented on triangle](2016-09-23_002_2-rays_r814_g3d_r848__Basic_shading_implemented_on_triangle.jpg)

Our direct illumination equation is implemented properly. Now, all we need to do
is check intersections.

2016-09-22 TriTree email from Morgan
=============================================================================

Instantiate TriTree. 

It inherits from TriTreeBase. Different classes implement TriTree on different platforms...EmbreeTriTree happens to be the current one used on Windows, but don't directly use EmbreeTriTree, let the magic happen behind the scenes so that your code will work on other platforms and in the future.

2016-09-22 Filling up array of surfaces
=============================================================================


Good idea! But I'm even lazier. I just called this method on the array of Surfaces:

Ok,

So, we want to use onPose on our Scene to fill up an array of Surfaces, as we can ask each Surface for its tris using getTrisHomogenous

2016-09-22 to show images on screen...
=============================================================================
GApp::Show. Or you can literally just type show(image)


2016-09-22 Lab continued
=============================================================================

Through many conceptual struggles, we have now realized that even though we can't include
any intersection code in anything we turn in, we CAN use it for the DRAFT level.

Right now, we're only getting a white screen, even using intersection code that we know works. We think
this has to do with the ray construction, as every single pixel is giving us the same ray. This obviously
doesn't make any sense, as every eyeRay should have a different direction. However, Ryan just solved it while sitting
next to me.
