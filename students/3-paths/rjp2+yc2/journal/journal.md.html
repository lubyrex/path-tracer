2016-10-03: Sponza 500 Paths 6 Scatters
=============================================================

2016-10-03: Some Soft Shadows
=============================================================

2016-10-03: Some Diffuse Inter-reflection
=============================================================

2016-10-03: Some Nice Mirroring
=============================================================

2016-10-03: Gamma test 2 
=============================================================
![](2016-10-03_002_3-paths_r1319_g3d_r875__.jpg)

changing from 4 .4 to 0.4 produced no difference so this clearly failed



2016-10-03: Gamma test 1
=============================================================

![](2016-10-03_001_3-paths_r1319_g3d_r875__.jpg)



2016-10-03: Want to add ability to change Gamma value
=============================================================
Can't seem to get it working



2016-10-03: Applying the modulation buffer to emitted light as well helped a lot
=============================================================

![](2016-10-03_000_3-paths_r1319_g3d_r875__.jpg)

Also a fixed a couple of direction vectors giving us reflections and caustics.



2016-10-02: 513 Rays Per Pixel and 1 Scattering Event Test
=============================================================

![](2016-10-02_007_3-paths_r1266_g3d_r875__.jpg)



2016-10-02: Pixels still going to just all white 
=============================================================

![](2016-10-02_006_3-paths_r1266_g3d_r875__.jpg)

The number of all-white pixels goes up with the number of scattering events.



2016-10-02: Some semblance of reflection
=============================================================

![](2016-10-02_004_3-paths_r1251_g3d_r875__.jpg)





2016-10-02: Speckling might indicate bumping problems
=============================================================

2016-10-02: Now creating shadow rays with max distances
=============================================================

![Now making shadowRays with max distances so can correctly check visibility](2016-10-02_001_3-paths_r1214_g3d_r875__Now_making_shadowRays_with_max_distances_so_can_correctly_check_visibility.jpg)



2016-10-02: Changed Visibility check to use TriTree:IntersectRays
=============================================================

![Changed Visibility check to use TriTree:IntersectRays](2016-10-02_000_3-paths_r1214_g3d_r875__Changed_Visibility_check_to_use_TriTree_IntersectRays.jpg)



Bug Found: weren't resetting modulation buffer before each raysPerPixel iteration
=============================================================
Thanks Morgan.



2016-10-01: when we don't modify the modulation buffer at all
=============================================================

![](2016-10-01_003_3-paths_r1198_g3d_r875__.jpg)

5 rays vs 25 rays vs 50 rays, the noise gets slightly smaller



2016-10-01: Weird bumping equation results
=============================================================

Also seem to have inconsistencies with which are bumping point for recursive rays but works better for what seems to be the wrong way

are bumping by (EPSILON * n * (-sign(n.dot(-w_i))));

Seems like should be (EPSILON * n * (-sign(m.dot(w_i))));

Why does the first work better? Clearly there are other underlying problems.



2016-10-01: Faces not touched by direct light always black
=============================================================

![Turning up the rays doesnt change the fact that the faces not touched by direct light are always black, which indicates our direct rays arent working well](2016-10-01_002_3-paths_r1171_g3d_r875__Turning_up_the_rays_doesnt_change_the_fact_that_the_faces_not_touched_by_direct_light_are_always_black__which_indicates_our_direct_rays_arent_working_well.jpg)

Turning up the rays doesn't change the fact that the faces not touched by direct light are always black, which indicates our direct rays arent working well


2016-10-01: Modulation buffer may be causing our darkness problem
=============================================================

![](2016-10-01_001_3-paths_r1171_g3d_r875__.jpg)

When you stop multiplying the modulation buffer by the 'weight' we have normal levels of light


Image gets very dark as increase number of rays per pixel
=============================================================

2016-09-30: Iteration Bug fixed
=============================================================

![](2016-09-30_003_3-paths_r1164_g3d_r875__.jpg)

we were using x*y + x instead of x*width + x for the i value that iterates
through our loop




2016-09-30: Changed scatter function to not use Russian Roulette
=============================================================

![](2016-09-30_002_3-paths_r1159_g3d_r875__.jpg)



2016-09-30: Fixed CheckVisibility to correctly return when surfel is null
=============================================================




2016-09-30: Put Image Writing before modulationBuffer Updating
=============================================================

![](2016-09-30_001_3-paths_r1159_g3d_r875__.jpg)



2016-09-30: What in the world happened
=============================================================

![](2016-09-30_000_3-paths_r1159_g3d_r875__.jpg)



2016-09-30:Shadow Ray isn;t intersecting anything, why???
==========================================

For some reason. our shadow rays (from the light to the surfel) aren't intersecting anything, which doesnt make any sense.
For now will just check for that happening, but am very confused as to why.
