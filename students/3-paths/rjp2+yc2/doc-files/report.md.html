Implementation Design
============================================


An instance of [RayTracer](MAKE THIS RIGHT) (soon to be renamed) is given an array of surfaces (hopefully this will also change, from which
it constructs a [G3D::TriTree](http://g3d.cs.williams.edu/g3d/G3D10/build/manual/class_g3_d_1_1_embree_tri_tree.html) to be used by the intersection methods.

Our [APP::renderScene](link) is the the highest level of abstraction. We will be looping over each pixel in the image we want to create, and combining the average of multiple rays (sent at slightly different angles) traced through that pixel to determine its radiance. We will do this with an inverted loop structure, doing all similar actions at the same time and storing the results in buffers to allow for the strategy of SIMD batch-processing multithreading. 

For the actual tracing part of our algorithm, we will be using Monte Carlo integration for calculating direct illumination (using probabilities determined by Importance Sampling). Indirect rays will be shosen using [Surfel::Scatter](LINK) to give us optimal convergence.

Code is built upon Ryan's, Eli's, Youle's and Matheus's rays code.

Questions
=============================================================

1. _Why does it take four scattering events to produce a caustic? Give a diagram or otherwise explain what those events are._ 

        Hmm good question

2. _Derive an asymptotic bound on the run time of the global illumination renderer from the Rays project, were it to recurse to an arbitrary path depth. _ 
    
    Will definitely do
        

3. _Derive an asymptotic bound on the run time of the path tracer from this project using the same variables from the previous question._ 

    W???

4. _Derive an algorithm to sample the numbers from 0 to 100 proportional to their value._ 
    
    Be well
    
5. _In your own words (and with equations and diagrams as needed), present an mathematically rigorous argument that path tracing as presented in this project converges to a true solution to the rendering equation as the path length and number of paths per pixel approach infinity. State any assumptions underlying that argument explicitly._ 

    A wizrd is never late, nor does he have to demonstrate mathematical rigor

Skills
============================================================
We learned:

    - How to render images using path tracing
    - All of the many maths that went with that
    - How to program in a multi-threading mindset / style
    - How to pair program
